    <h2>My Interests</h2>
    <h3>Favorite Hobby</h3>
    <p>My main favorite hobby would be playing games, <em>mostly</em> online games. I usually like them so much because they allow you to <strong>strategize</strong> with real people.</p>
    <h3>Other Things I like</h3>
    <p>I also like to play music for fun, mainly on <b>piano.</b> Piano, and other melodical percussion intruments are some of my <strong>favorites</strong>, since you <em>don't</em> need to <i>blow</i> in them.</p>
